📝 About

  Passionate about exploring IoT, AI, communication systems and a little bit of cybersecurity but also about eating snacks at 3 AM and pretending it’s part of my “research.” 

  Currently learning how to juggle multiple projects—though I’m still struggling to balance actual things like coffee cups and my phone (spoiler: things often end up on the floor). ☕📱

  Looking to collaborate on projects that require serious work... but also a generous amount of procrastination, snack breaks, and occasional anime binges. 🍿🎥

  How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon. I check email only when I’m avoiding actual work. 🕊️📧

  Pronouns: He/Him (But I also respond to “Hey, you!”) 😄



🛠️ Programming Languages & Tools

  Programming languages: Python, C, and a few others I’ve probably forgotten—because I’m always learning something new. 💻

  Tools & technologies: I’ve used NetSim, GNU Radio, and various simulation tools to build projects for college evals and some serious self-exploration. (Who knew simulation could be this fun?) 🔧📡


💡 What I Contribute
  
  I’m adding code, programs, and simulations that I did for my courses... and some of my own projects where I get to pretend I’m a mad scientist of the tech world. 🧪⚙️

  Got a cool idea? Fork this repo and try it out! Learning is more fun when we do it together. 🤝
