# 👋 Hey, I’m Aravind (a.k.a. “that guy who codes at 3 AM”)

---

## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Python-and-coffee-fueled night coder who loves solving problems — even if it means debugging till sunrise.  
Exploring the world of **IoT, AI, and cybersecurity**, and constantly building things that are 10% innovation and 90% trial-and-error.  

Currently juggling multiple projects (with some success!) and always on the lookout for fun collaborations.

**Pronouns:** He/Him | Also responds to: “Bro,” “Dude,” or “The guy who just fixed it.”  
**Fun Fact:** If you spot me being productive, it's probably accidental. 😄

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, C, a bit of Bash and HTML/CSS  
- **Tools:** GNU Radio, NetSim, Linux, VSCode, Git  
- **Domains:** IoT, Embedded Systems, Cybersecurity, AI/ML  
- **Current Focus:** TensorFlow/Keras, automation scripts, smarter Wi-Fi (still working on that last one)

## 🧪 What I’m Building

- A “secret” AI project (equal parts code, chaos, and curiosity)  
- IoT stuff that sometimes listens to me  
- Scripts that make life easier — or at least funnier  

---

## 🎯 2025 Goals

- Ship more, stress less  
- Collaborate more with devs around the world  
- Build something that gets starred more than once 😅  
- Touch grass (maybe)

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

Got a cool idea? Ping me. Always up for brainstorming, building, or just geeking out over tech.  
(Emails work better than carrier pigeons — but both are cool.)
