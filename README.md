👀 Passionate about exploring IoT, AI, and communication systems, but also about eating snacks at 3 AM and pretending it’s part of my “research.”
🌱 Currently learning how to balance multiple projects, and failing miserably at balancing actual things (like coffee cups and my phone).
💞️ Looking to collaborate on projects that require serious work, but also a healthy amount of procrastination and snack breaks.
📫 How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon. I’m only on email when I’m avoiding actual work.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him (but I also answer to “Hey, you!”).
✨ Curious, creative, and committed to learning every day. Let’s build something awesome together—preferably while having some fun. 🍕
