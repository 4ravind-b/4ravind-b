# 👋 Hey, I’m Aravind (a.k.a. “that guy who codes at 3 AM”)

---

## 📝 About Me

I’m a Python-and-coffee-fueled creature of the night, occasionally seen pretending to be productive while actually Googling "why is my code not working." 🐍☕

Passionate about exploring **IoT, AI**, and **cybersecurity** — especially when it involves outsmarting things that were never smart to begin with.  

Currently trying to master the art of juggling multiple projects... and failing spectacularly. (Coffee cups, phones, and dignity — all dropped at some point.) ☕📱💥

### 📨 How to reach me  
Send a carrier pigeon. I check email only when Mercury isn’t in retrograde. 🕊️📧  
**Pronouns:** He/Him (but I also respond to “Dude,” “Bro,” or “HEY YOU WITH THE BUGGY CODE”) 😄

---

🛠️ **Skills, Tools & Tech**

Here’s a list of my “I learned this... once” superpowers:

- **Python 🐍**: Learned it in college, forgot the syntax, Googled it back into my brain.  
- **C 💻**: Survived enough pointers to call it “expertise” (ish).  
- **NetSim 🌐**: I can simulate networks… until a packet drops and I panic.  
- **GNU Radio 📡**: Built flowgraphs that kind-of-sort-of work—most of the time.  
- **Linux 🐧**: I know enough commands to feel dangerous in a terminal.  
- **IoT 🔌**: My devices are “smart” enough to ignore me sometimes.

</p>

Here’s the **totally serious** breakdown of my coding life:

- ☕ **Coffee Cups Consumed:** Approximately one per bug encountered (so… a lot).  
- 🍪 **Snack Breaks Taken:** Enough to fuel a small army of procrastinators.  
- 🐞 **Bugs Squashed:** Countless—each with its own dramatic backstory.  
- 🌙 **Midnight Coding Hours:** When the rest of the world sleeps, my brain powers on.  

*(Yes, these stats are real… I think.)*

## 📚 Currently Learning

- TensorFlow/Keras stuff and pretending to understand it  
- How to write documentation without crying  
- Mastering the art of accidentally DDoS’ing your own Wi-Fi at 2 AM 🌐💥  
- Cybersecurity fun things that make me feel like a hacker (without going to jail)

---

## 🎯 Goals for 2025

- Finally automate my snack ordering with AI  
- Build something cool and tell everyone “it’s just a prototype”  
- Submit at least one project before the deadline (just once... please)  
- Touch grass (no promises)

## 🧪 What I Contribute

Uploading college projects, personal experiments, and random “aha!” moments that hit at 3 AM. Basically: I break things until they work. 🧪⚙️

Got an idea? Fork it, break it, fix it — let’s build cool stuff together. 🤝

### 🧑‍💻 My Current Project:

I’m currently working on a **super-secret AI project**. No, it’s not as mysterious as it sounds... or is it? Either way, it involves a lot of Python, some questionable decisions, and maybe even a little bit of magic. 🔮✨ Feel free to ask about it if you can handle the mystery.

## 👋 Thanks for stopping by!
