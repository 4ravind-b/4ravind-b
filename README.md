# 👋 Hey, I’m Aravind (a.k.a. “that guy who codes at 3 AM”)

---

## 📝 About Me

I’m a Python-and-coffee-fueled creature of the night, occasionally seen pretending to be productive while actually Googling "why is my code not working." 🐍☕  

Passionate about exploring **IoT, AI**, and **cybersecurity** — especially when it involves outsmarting things that were never smart to begin with.  

Currently trying to master the art of juggling multiple projects... and failing spectacularly. (Coffee cups, phones, and dignity — all dropped at some point.) ☕📱💥

### 📨 How to reach me:
Send a carrier pigeon. Or just email me when Mercury isn’t in retrograde. 🕊️📧

**Pronouns**: He/Him (but I also respond to “Dude,” “Bro,” or “HEY YOU WITH THE BUGGY CODE”) 😄

---

## 🛠️ Skills, Tools & Tech

**Languages**: Python, C, Bash, Markdown (because formatting is a lifestyle)  
**Tools**: Linux, GNU Radio, NetSim, Git, and deep Googling

## 📚 Currently Learning
  
- TensorFlow/Keras stuff and pretending to understand it  
- How to write documentation without crying  
- Mastering the art of accidentally DDoS’ing your own Wi-Fi at 2 AM 🌐💥  
- Cybersecurity fun things that make me feel like a hacker (without going to jail)

---

## 🎯 Goals for 2025

- Finally automate my snack ordering with AI  
- Build something cool and tell everyone “it’s just a prototype”  
- Submit at least one project before the deadline (just once... please)  
- Touch grass (no promises)

## 🧪 What I Contribute

Uploading college projects, personal experiments, and random “aha!” moments that hit at 3 AM. Basically: I break things until they work. 🧪⚙️

Got an idea? Fork it, break it, fix it — let’s build cool stuff together. 🤝

### 🛸 Random Fact

I once debugged a project for 3 hours before realizing I hadn’t saved the file. A moment of silence, please. 😔💾

---

### 🧑‍💻 My Current Project:
I'm currently building a **super-secret project** involving some cool AI and Python magic. It's top secret, but feel free to ask me about it! 🔮

## 👋 Thanks for stopping by!
