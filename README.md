# 👋 Hey, I’m Aravind (a.k.a. “that guy who codes at 3 AM”)

---

## 📝 About Me

I’m a Python-and-coffee-fueled creature of the night, occasionally seen Googling “why is my code not working” — and then fixing it like a pro. 🐍☕  
Passionate about exploring **IoT, AI**, and **cybersecurity**, especially when it involves making things smarter (or at least funnier).

Currently juggling multiple projects like a caffeine-powered multitasking machine. Some fall, some fly — but I learn from all of them. ☕📱💥

### 📨 How to reach me  
Send a carrier pigeon. I only check email when my Wi-Fi signal is strong and my caffeine level is critical. 🕊️📧  
**Pronouns:** He/Him (also responds to “Dude,” “Bro,” or “HEY YOU WITH THE BUGGY CODE”) 😄

## 🛠️ Skills, Tools & Tech

Here’s a list of my “I learned this… and actually kept learning” superpowers:

- **Python 🐍**: Learned it in college, forgot the syntax, re-Googled it into muscle memory.  
- **C 💻**: Pointers? Been there. Done that. Survived.  
- **NetSim 🌐**: I simulate networks… then panic when a packet drops.  
- **GNU Radio 📡**: Built flowgraphs that run — and occasionally impress me.  
- **Linux 🐧**: Comfortable enough in the terminal to feel powerful (and occasionally dangerous).  
- **IoT 🔌**: Built devices that are smart, sassy, and sometimes smarter than they seem.

</p>

Here’s the **totally serious** breakdown of my coding life:

- ☕ **Coffee Cups Consumed:** Approximately one per bug encountered (so… a lot).  
- 🍪 **Snack Breaks Taken:** Enough to fuel a small army of procrastinators.  
- 🐞 **Bugs Squashed:** Countless — each with its own dramatic backstory.  
- 🌙 **Midnight Coding Hours:** When the world sleeps, my brain powers up.  

*(Yes, these stats are absolutely legit. Trust the vibes.)*

## 📚 Currently Learning

- TensorFlow/Keras stuff (and surprisingly making sense of it)  
- How to write documentation without tears  
- Mastering the art of not crashing my Wi-Fi at 2 AM 🌐💥  
- Cybersecurity tools and tricks that make me feel like a legal hacker 🕶️💻  

---

## 🎯 Goals for 2025

- Finally automate my snack ordering with AI  
- Build something cool and pretend it's "just a prototype"  
- Submit at least one project before the deadline (it’s happening, I swear)  
- Touch grass (considering it)

## 🧪 What I Contribute

Uploading college projects, personal experiments, and random “aha!” moments that strike at 3 AM.  
I build things, break things, and fix them — with enough chaos to call it creativity.  
Got an idea? Fork it, break it, fix it — let's make something cool together. 🤯⚙️

### 🎮 It’s Just How I Look Before a Deadline

### 🧑‍💻 My Current Project

I’m working on a **super-secret AI project**. It’s equal parts Python, questionable decisions, and a dash of magic. 🔮✨  
Ask me about it — if you're ready for the mystery.
